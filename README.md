Mostly platform/version independent api for MaLiLib.

Minecraft classes this mod directly interfaces with (yarn names):
* MinecraftClient
* DrawContext
* Screen
* MinecraftVersion

Despite only being for fabric, does not rely on any of fabrics stuff (neither fabric loader, nor fabric api.

Soon:
 - other versions
 - custom config/widget support
